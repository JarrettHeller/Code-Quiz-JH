Coding Quiz For KU coding bootcamp

Working (Mostly) Coding quiz for class
I have had trouble getting everything done, and i need to turn it in, so some things don't work
The high score thing doesn't work, and i couldn't set it up in time, and when questions are
answered wrong it speeds up the timer. It also infinitly loops the questions until the time has reached zero,
which it then resets.

It has 5 questions with different amounts of answers to show the knowladge, and has a colored background
when a question is answered, the correct answer will glow green, and the wrong answers will glow red.
